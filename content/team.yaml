  description: "Henry chose computers as a career after writing tools to get through high school calculus. After cutting his teeth on PHP 5 building web apps for the federal judiciary, he’s now a DevOps engineer who enjoys process automation in the name of better developer experience. When he’s not turning coffee into tools or organizing things for IO, he’s usually rock climbing, cooking, or rooting for the Packers."

He writes Ruby on Rails for a New Haven-based company, as well as performs comedy all over the tri-state area (mostly Connecticut, if we're being honest). He loves riding bikes, playing video games, and starting pointless arguments and then leaving before it gets ugly."
